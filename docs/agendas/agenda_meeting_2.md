## Code of Conduct
Discuss the [assessment criteria](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/le/content/595286/viewContent/3617397/View) (below are summaries of the requirements)
 - team values need description+explanation
 - description of assignment clear and detailed
 - agreement on ambition level, justify it being realistic, discuss different ambitions of team members and the balance of it
 - planning - clear rules and goals
 - discuss the internal deadlines for assignments/when to finish certain features
 - behaviour - also consider academic counsellors as possible third parties to be involved
 - communication - plan of notifying the TA/keeping them in the loop
 - commitment - minimum quality of group work + chairs/minute takers and how to convey this to each other
 - decision making - discuss what to do when somebody insists on a different viewpoint + when/how to involve the feedback/suggestions from the TA
 - conflicts - policy in case of escalation + when to involve the TA
 - consequences - general consequences + scale with gravity of situation + "other" scenario
 - outside collaboration - meeting pretty good already?
## First Steps
- Checkstyle (10+ rules)
- Test coverage
- JavaDoc
- CI/CD configuration
- Start with basic requirements - what is achievable to be implemented this week
---
### Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*
### Feedback round
### Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*
### Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*
### Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
