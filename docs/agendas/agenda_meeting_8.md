### Opening
Making sure everyone is present and feeling fine, positive atmosphere is much needed.
### Check-in
How was last weeks work? Any issues? Anything you found out worth sharing with others?
Were the goals set for last week met? Is everyone happy with progress so far?
### Approval of the agenda and last minutes
- Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.
- Make sure everybody read the minutes of the last meeting, as well as the TA feedback as it is helpful to improve certain aspects using the given advice.
### Product Pitch
Accomplished goals ~ Presenting the work so far to the TA. Mock presentation in the form of the oral exam
### Feedback and Announcements by the TA
Listen carefully, incorporating the advice and understanding the upcoming mission is of great benefit for the speed and quality of the project.
- Feedback on the implemented features and the format of the product pitch
- Announcements about the course and examination, reminders about upcoming deadlines
### Points of action
- Very briefly reflect on the current state of the project; has the non-mandatory functionality be completed? If not: is help from other teammates needed to finish?
- Which non-mandatory functionality do we aim to implement? And to which extent?
- Self reflection: is progress coming along? Did anyone want to discuss briefly?
### Questions for the TA
Does the team have any (technical) questions for the TA that are needed for completing the action points of the week?
### Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*
- Non-mandatory functionality implementation 
- Draft self-reflection
- Polish product pitch for oral examination
### General feedback round
What went well and what can be improved next time, looking back on the previous week?
### Any other business
- If any new ideas came up after the feedback round, it is never too late to make something out of them.
- If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.
### Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*
### Closing
*Now you can keep working on the project. Good luck!*
