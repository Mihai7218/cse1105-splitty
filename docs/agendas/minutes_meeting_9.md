### Opening
Making sure everyone is present and feeling fine, positive atmosphere is much needed.
### Check-in
How was the last week? How are the tasks for this week going?
### Approval of the agenda and last minutes
- Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.
- Make sure everybody read the minutes of the last meeting, as well as the TA feedback as it is helpful to improve certain aspects using the given advice.
### Feedback and Announcements by the TA

- Code freeze is this friday
- Friday deadline for buddycheck and self reflection, remember to use the AID model!
- Update the ReadMe (this is an issue currently)
  - add any interesting features
- course evaluation is also open, talk about what you liked as well as what you didn't like

### Presentation of the application to the TA
Presenting the work so far to the TA.

- Admin functionality breaks for imports
- Extensions look okay, detailed expenses and open debts are missing one point

### Points of action
- Reminder to complete the BuddyCheck this week
- Testing - how should we split the classes to test amongst ourselves?
  - divide up each class
  - review testing rubric
- We should also look at each user/admin flow from the backlog and see if it works in our application without errors/uncaught exceptions
  - throughout the week people can test that stuff for their assigned classes
  - Go through entire application and look for bugs
  - also for the assigned testing classes look for bugs yourself by messing around with the UI.
- What is there left to do for the basic/extended functionality? Is it assigned, and, if so, how is it going?
  - Detailed expenses is missing transfers, same with open debts
  - Admin functionality needs imports fixed
- HCI rubric - do we have at least 6 of them? If not, what should we add?
  - good, fix error messages, add undo support
  - test keyboard navigation
- When are we going to meet again this week?
  - Friday during the break and potentially after linear algebra

### Questions for the TA
Does the team have any (technical) questions for the TA that are needed for completing the action points of the week?

Exchange rates: 
- should be okay but TA will check how to integrate the two extensions

HCI:
- Not pass or fail, but need at least 6 to get any points for it.

Product Pitch:
- Make sure to cover as much of the functionality as possible, they will not be grading it at that moment but to get a 'Good' on the rubric you need to provide a good overview of functionality
- Other rubrics are reviewed and filled out separately.

Self Reflection: 
- the assignment will be added as a Summative assignment later this week, make sure to submit there!

### Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*
To Finish:
- testing
  - get to 80% line coverage (please please please)
  - review rubric to add the different test types as well (behavior, indirect input, indirect output)
- fix admin functionality
- add HCI functionality
- go through all rubrics and add anything that we can that is missing
- Work on presentation (more next week, but if time add that to this week)
### General feedback round
What went well and what can be improved next time, looking back on the previous week?
### Any other business
- If any new ideas came up after the feedback round, it is never too late to make something out of them.
- If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), they should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.
### Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*
### Closing
*Now you can keep working on the project. Good luck!*
