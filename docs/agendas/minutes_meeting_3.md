## Opening and check-in
- All team members came timely to the meeting
- Everyone completed their tasks assigned to them the last meeting
- Realized that the pipeline in GitLab fails for the toStringTest method in any of the classes,
        have to work our way round the problem
- Merge requests should be approved faster so not to have problems merging code later in the project

## Advice from TA
- Reviews have to be constructive, actually check the code that will be uploaded
- Create issues, labels and milestones in GitLab; equally divide the tasks
- Work on the backlog
- Recommended to work during week 5, even tho not compulsory
- Use the AID (Action, Impact, Do) model for the Buddycheck feedback
- Divide the team into backend and frontend to work in parallel and combine everything nicely afterward

## Taking action
- We split the team for frontend/backend and decided to switch each 2 weeks
        so that everyone gets to learn about both
- Get used to JavaFX, Mockito, create seeds, implement API methods
- Prepare for next meeting: chairman - Vlad; minute_taker - Azra
- Work and submit Code of Conduct, deadline on Friday 29th of February

## Feedback
- Everyone passed the Git assignment, well done!
- Questions for the TA: How did the project go for them? How is the knock-out criteria applied?

## Wrap-up
- The meeting ended a little early due to most things being discussed earlier in our 'own meeting'
- Upload the minutes separate from the agenda itself
