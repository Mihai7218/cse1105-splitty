### Opening
Making sure everyone is present and feeling fine, positive atmosphere is much needed.
### Check-in
How was the last week? How are the tasks for this week going?
### Approval of the agenda and last minutes
- Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.
- Make sure everybody read the minutes of the last meeting, as well as the TA feedback as it is helpful to improve certain aspects using the given advice.
### Feedback and Announcements by the TA
Listen carefully, incorporating the advice and understanding the upcoming mission is of great benefit for the speed and quality of the project.
- Feedback on the implemented features and the format of the product pitch
- Announcements about the course and examination, reminders about upcoming deadlines
### Presentation of the application to the TA
Presenting the work so far to the TA.
### Points of action
- Reminder to complete the BuddyCheck this week
- Testing - how should we split the classes to test amongst ourselves?
- We should also look at each user/admin flow from the backlog and see if it works in our application without errors/uncaught exceptions
- What is there left to do for the basic/extended functionality? Is it assigned, and, if so, how is it going?
- HCI rubric - do we have at least 6 of them? If not, what should we add?
- When are we going to meet again this week?
### Questions for the TA
Does the team have any (technical) questions for the TA that are needed for completing the action points of the week?
### Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*
### General feedback round
What went well and what can be improved next time, looking back on the previous week?
### Any other business
- If any new ideas came up after the feedback round, it is never too late to make something out of them.
- If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), they should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.
### Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*
### Closing
*Now you can keep working on the project. Good luck!*
