### Opening
Making sure everyone is present and feeling fine, positive atmosphere is much needed.

Everyone is doing ok 
### Check-in
How was last week work? Any issues? Anything you found out worth sharing with others?

Most of the team experienced the tasks as taking longer than expected. 
### Announcements by the team
Accomplished goals ~ Upcoming plan

No announcements were made
### Approval of the agenda
Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.

The agenda was approved by the team
### Approval of last minutes
Make sure everybody read the minutes of the last meeting, as well as the TA feedback as it is helpful to improve certain aspects using the given advice.

The team read the minutes from the last meeting before this meeting
### Announcements by the TA
Listen carefully, incorporating the advice and understanding the upcoming mission is of great benefit for the speed and quality of the project.

- Buddy check due this week, use AID model.
- Repair option for one of the buddychecks, not both.
- Next week: 2 rubrics; code contribution & technology rubric

- Technology: websockets, injections etc. => look at rubric and incorporate rubric criteria in project

Questions:
- Recently viewed events => follow backlog instead of mockups 
- See total sum of expenses => for the whole event. 
- Per person: total summed share
### App presentation
New features implemented by both the frontend and backend team.

Overview was not merged yet
### Action points for next week (Scrum board)
- BuddyCheck, due on 8th of March
- Linking front-end scenes together, transitions, try to avoid conflicts
- Admin functionality for back-end team, terminal based
- Retrieving actual data from the database
### Feedback round
Based on the principles in the Code of Conduct, healthy constructive feedback is of great value.

- Code of Conduct: TA feedback was positive
- Keep up with the good work :D
- Discuss when we want to finish the mandatory functionality => team agrees before week 6
- Discuss which Epics we want to prioritise, delegate tasks
### Any other business
If any new ideas came up after the feedback round, it is never too late to make something out of them.

### Question round
If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.

- Questions to TA about admin functionality: terminal-based is the easiest/most logical option
- Code of Conduct: is it useful to make changes? => assignment is formative, changing does not impact grade, only helpful for self reflection
- Lecture question about why lecture was relevant => lecture focuses on HCI/user experience 
- Buddycheck: rate teammate on scale of 1-5, give tip and top based on AID model
- Buddycheck: does grade count towards final grade? => no. Only to see which team members aren't contributing (enough). Learning to give, receive, and incorporate constructive feedback
- Final examination: rubrics (testing, technology) all have a percentage => graded at the end of the project. Reviews, code contribution etc. are for process. Final examination is an oral presentation of the application
### Closing
Now you can continue working on the project. Good luck!

Meeting closed at 15:21
