### Opening
Making sure everyone is present and feeling fine, positive atmosphere is much needed.

- everyone is present and we all met the criteria
### Check-in
How was last weeks work? Any issues? Anything you found out worth sharing with others?
Were the goals set for last week met? Is everyone happy with progress so far?

- Statistics took longer/did not work at all
### Approval of the agenda and last minutes
- Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.
- Make sure everybody read the minutes of the last meeting, as well as the TA feedback as it is helpful to improve certain aspects using the given advice.

- previous minutes and current agenda were approved
### Product Pitch
Accomplished goals ~ Presenting the work so far to the TA. Mock presentation in the form of the oral exam

- total time was 12m 30s, some parts were quicker than others (start and overview took as long as the rest of the product pitch)
### Feedback and Announcements by the TA
Listen carefully, incorporating the advice and understanding the upcoming mission is of great benefit for the speed and quality of the project.
- Feedback on the implemented features and the format of the product pitch
- Announcements about the course and examination, reminders about upcoming deadlines

Announcements made by the TA:
 - server change should be a scene
 - template for the language feature - unclear how this should be implemented
 - only one screen for the presentation
 - after the presentation - Q&A - lecture slides, what you did (they can ask more about what other people did)
 - check the slides, go through the code
 - make sure to be aware of both the frontend and the backend for the presentation
 - presentation questions: more focused on the lecture material

Feedback given by the TA:
- slides are good (especially the story)
- presentation too long, record demo, combine slides with video
### Points of action
- Very briefly reflect on the current state of the project; has the non-mandatory functionality be completed? If not: is help from other teammates needed to finish?
- Which non-mandatory functionality do we aim to implement? And to which extent?
- Self reflection: is progress coming along? Did anyone want to discuss briefly?

##### mandatory functionality:
- skipped as it was discussed during the product pitch part
##### non-mandatory functionality:
- language feature - mostly done, only the add template feature needs to be added
- detailed expenses - Azra is working on them
- currencies - Mihai is working on it, needs to be update 
- detailed expenses 3rd point - mark as paid/debts 2nd point - mark payment as received
- email invites - wait on it
##### self-reflection:
- everyone will work on it on their own
### Questions for the TA
Does the team have any (technical) questions for the TA that are needed for completing the action points of the week?

-  Q: absolute/relative in statistics
-  A: relative - pie chart + display percentages; absolute - the amount of money

-  Q: is a legend for the pie chart needed?
-  A: not specifically mentioned; arrows are fine

- Q: should weights be added to previous issues?
- A: not really, only on the new ones

- Q: formative self-reflection. can it be skipped?
- A: yes, but a pass on the formative will lead to a pass on the summative as well

- Q: self-reflection describe what you did on a technical level - is that describing what you coded?
- A: talk about what you did + more interesting features you coded

- Q: criteria between formative/summative different?
- A: no, so you can just submit the same self-reflection if you passed the formative
### Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*
- Non-mandatory functionality implementation 
- Draft self-reflection
- Polish product pitch for oral examination

TODOs:
 - first requirement with the server
 - admin - return from methods
 - fix application not running when the folder of the config is missing
 - merge the requests that are currently open
 - Azra: work on the detailed expenses
 - Mihai: update currency extension
 - Philip: work on the statistics
### General feedback round
What went well and what can be improved next time, looking back on the previous week?
 - TA: we are on track, basic functionality is almost done + working 
### Any other business
- If any new ideas came up after the feedback round, it is never too late to make something out of them.
- If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all. 

### Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

- no general questions were added, the questions for the TA were added above
### Closing
*Now you can keep working on the project. Good luck!*
