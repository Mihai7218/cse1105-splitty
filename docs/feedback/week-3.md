# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The meeting had a chair and a minute taker. 


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
- Tops: The agenda was added to the repository in time. I like the way the information was structured, you wrote concrete action points for the meeting and you filled in the agenda with useful information.  Good job!
- Tips: The action points for the next week could be a bit more structured (I don't understand what you want to say from "endpoints"). 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: Make sure you merge the notes into the agenda file after each meeting.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
- Tops: Nice job! You covered most topics from the agenda. Is nice that you started the meeting by letting everyone say what they did in the last week. I liked the way you conducted the meeting, you took initiative and listened to others. You followed the agenda structure and didn't miss any part. 
- Tips: I think you did a very good job. The only thing I can say is that at the feedback round you can just name everyone one by one so everyone talks:) 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
- Tops: The team took ownership of the meeting, making the atmosphere constructive. Almost everyone was actively contributing with ideas and also listening to others. Good job! 
- Tips: Make sure that everyone talks and is active during the meeting. I saw an improvement from last week tho:)


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- Tops: The team presented the current state of the application. The progress is fine for the first week of coding.
- Tips: As soon as you have some scenes ready or some interesting functionality make sure that you show it to me during the meeting. Make sure that this week you start working on more useful features.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
- Tops: I like that you started the meeting by saying what you did in the previous week. Everyone finished their tasks from the previous week. For now it seems like the contribution is somewhat equal. Make sure that you explain what you did in the previous week in each meeting.
- Tips: Make sure that everyone contributes somewhat equally. You don't need to count lines, but remember that you are a team and you should make sure that everyone contributes to the project.
