# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The meeting had a chair and a minute taker. 


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- Tops: The agenda was added to the repository in time and you filled some action points.
- Tips: Make sure that you fill in the agenda template, the agenda should contain questions from the team that you want to ask during the meeting, important deadlines, problems, conflict, action points, what you did before. You should make it a bit more comprehensive, right now is a bit superficial.
