# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and minute taker


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Agenda was added to the repository in time and there were some clear points but overall it seems quite general, try to add more specific points, more specific questions not just topics that need to be discussed, e.g. what needs to be discussed in that topic. One last thing  I think approval of the agenda goes before going around and saying what you did? going around seems as something that is part of the agenda.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Notes have the structure of the agenda and there is a good amount of notes the action points look good but maybe next time you can discuss what each person will do and have that in the notes.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: Chair covered all the topics within time I like how you gave the speach to others to contribute their ideas and when the discussion was over you made sure to move on. I feel that you could add a bit more energy to the meeting, it would help the others open up a bit more.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Very good organization of the meeeting, there was good constructive discussion wiith everyone contributing ideas. I might have bad ears and not sure if you were shy but it was hard to hear what you were saying (especially with the background noise). I also liked that in the beginning you mentioned a problem you had e.g. issues with testing, and that you are helping eachother out.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: The app presentation was good, I would say you are on track, some features are not implemented but you still have time to implement them. Make sure to start looking into implementing long polling and websockets. Unfortunately I don't know the state of the app compared to week 4 but I am guessing/hoping there was improvement : )



#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: You discussed what you did last week, I am assuming those were action points from last week. Everyone seems to be equally involved in the project which is great!
